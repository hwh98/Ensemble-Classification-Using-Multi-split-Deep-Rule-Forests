# Ensemble-Classification-Using-Multi-split-Deep-Rule-Forests
This repository contains the implementation of a multi-split Deep Rule Forest (DRF) machine learning algorithm developed in R. The multi-split DRF enhances the traditional DRF by improving data representation learning and classification accuracy while maintaining interpretability.
